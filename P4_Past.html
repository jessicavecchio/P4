            		<h4>My time in Ultrasound</h4>
            		<br><p>Upon graduation from AIMS, I was hired at my internship site as a per diem tech. I was even trained in
            		their vascular lab which is one of the specialties that you don't get much training for in school.
            		Because of this, I was so grateful that I had the opportunity here. I had so much coverage
        			there that I was basically a full time worker! It was amazing. I learned so many great techniques there 
            		and took them with me as I moved to my full time job.</p>
            		<br><p>Hunterdon Medical Center was my first official full time employer. I worked here every single weekend
            		doing two 16 hour shifts completely alone, back to back, after doing a regular 8 hour shift. Working alone 
            		over the weekend was tough at times but it made me improve my time management and helped me feel even more
            		confident in myself. During the time at my job, I realized that I wanted more for my life and decided to 
            		start a degree in computer science.</p>
            		<br><p>Once COVID happened, I was told my employer could no longer afford my position and so for a brief time, 
            		I was furloughed. It was very scary to feel as if my job was at risk even though the ultrasound department within 
            		hospitals were deemed necessary to stay open. I was furloughed for about 6 months and within that time, I was 
            		told I was not guaranteed my job back so I began looking for other jobs.</p>
            		<br><p>At the end of 2020, I luckily found a new job that could replace part of my old shift since my old position
            		was not going to be available due to budget. Capital Health became my new home, and I am still working 
            		there to this day doing doubles on the weekend.</p>

            		<h4>My path to technical school</h4>
            		<br><p>During high school, I unfortunately got pretty acquainted with getting ultrasounds done due to the horrible
            		experience of having kidney stones. After getting ultrasounds done trying to search for my stones, I 
            		decided that I was really interested in performing ultrasounds.</p>
            		<br><p>When you get an ultrasound, if you haven't been trained to see what's on the screen, you will have no idea 
            		what you're actually looking at. It intrigued me so much and made me want to learn. This is what led me to going
            		to school at The American Institute of Medical Science and Education (AIMS).</p>
            		<br><p>During my time at AIMS, I met amazing professors and outstanding classmates. During my time here, I 
            		learned about general small parts and abdominal ultrasound,  obstetric and gynecological ultrasound, and 
            		vascular ultrasound. In the beginning, it was so hard to determine what was on the screen, but a few weeks 
            		in, everyones' lightbulb went off and we were all succeeding during our lab time.</p>
            		<br><p>After 3 years of lectures and labs, we all got to go to an assigned internship. I was lucky to be placed at
            		Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton and with a tech, Denise, that truly enjoyed teaching. 
            		Denise is why I am such a great ultrasound tech today.</p>
